# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, in reverse chronological order by release.

## 3.4.0 - TBD

### Added

- Nothing.

- Adds the ability to use the EventManager as a [PSR-14](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-14/) event dispatcher.

- Adds the following interfaces:
  - `Laminas\EventManager\EventDispatchingInterface`, for indicating a class composes an `EventDispatcherInterface` instance.
    This interface will replace the `Laminas\EventManager\EventsCapableInterface` in version 4.0.

  - `Laminas\Expressive\ListenerProvider\PrioritizedListenerProviderInterface`, which extends the `ListenerProviderInterface`, and adds the method `getListenersForEventByPriority($event, $identifiers = [])`.
    This method will return a list of integer priority keys mapping to lists of callable listeners.

  - `Laminas\Expressive\ListenerProvider\PrioritizedListenerAttachmentInterface`, which provides methods for attaching and detaching listeners with optional priority values.
    This interface largely replaces the various related methods in the current `EventManagerInterface`, and is for use with listener providers.

  - `Laminas\Expressive\ListenerProvider\ListenerSubscriberInterface`, for indicating that a class can attach multiple listeners to a `PrioritizedListenerAttachmentInterface` instance.
    This largely replaces the current `ListenerAggregateInterface` functionality.
    Users should likely use the PSR-14 utility package's `DelegatingProvider` instead, however.

- Adds the following listener provider classes and utilities:
  - `AbstractListenerSubscriber` and `ListenerSubscriberTrait` can be used to provide a generic way to detach subscribers.
    In most cases, `ListenerSubscriberInterface` implementations should define their own logic for doing so.

  - `PrioritizedListenerProvider` implements `PrioritizedListenerProviderInterface` and `PrioritizedListenerAttachmentInterface` in order to provide the various listener attachment and retrieval capabilities in previous versions of the `EventManager` class.

  - `PrioritizedIdentifierListenerProvider` implements `PrioritizedListenerProviderInterface` and `SharedEventManagerInterface`, and provides all features of the `SharedEventManager` class from previous versions of the package.

  - `PrioritizedAggregateListenerProvider` implements `PrioritizedListenerProviderInterface` and accepts a list of `PrioritizedListenerProviderInterface` instances and optionally a generic `ListenerProviderInterface` instance to its constructor.
    When retrieving listeners, it will loop through the `PrioritizedListenerProviderInterface` instance in order, yielding from each, and then, if present, yield from the generic `ListenerProviderInterface` instance.
    This approach essentially replaces the listener and shared listener aggregation in previous versions of the `EventManager`.

  - `LazyListener` combines the functionalities of `Zend\EventManager\LazyListener` and `Zend\EventManager\LazyEventListener`.
    If no event or priority are provided to the constructor, than the `getEvent()` and `getPriority()` methods will each return `null`.
    When invoked, the listener will pull the specified service from the provided DI container, and then invoke it.

  - `LazyListenerSubscriber` implements `ListenerSubscriberInterface` and accepts a list of `LazyListener` instances to its constructor; any non-`LazyListener` instances or any that do not define an event will cause
    the constructor to raise an exception.
    When its `attach()` method is called, it attaches the lazy listeners based on the event an priority values it pulls from them.

- Adds the static method `createUsingListenerProvider()` to the `EventManager` class.
  This method takes a `ListenerProviderInterface`, and will then pull directly from it when triggering events.
  If the provider also implements `PrioritizedListenerAttachmentInterface`, the various listener attachment methods defined in `EventManager` will proxy to it.

- Adds the static method `createUsingListenerProvider()` to the `EventManager`.

### Changed

- Modifies the `SharedEventManager` class to extend the new `Laminas\EventManager\ListenerProvider\PrioritizedIdentifierListenerProvider` class.

- Modifies the `EventManager` class as follows:
  - It now implements each of the PSR-14 `ListenerProviderInterface` and the new `PrioritizedListenerAttachmentInterface`.
  - If constructed normally, it will create a `PrioritizedListenerProvider` instance, and use that for all listener attachment.
    If a `SharedEventManagerInterface` is provided, it will create a `PrioritizedAggregateListenerProvider` using its own `PrioritizedListenerProvider` and the shared manager, and use that for fetching listeners.
  - Adds a `dispatch()` method as an alternative to the various `trigger*()` methods.

### Deprecated

- Deprecates the following interfaces and classes:
  - `Laminas\EventManager\EventInterface`.
    Users should start using vanilla PHP objects that encapsulate all expected behavior for setting and retrieving values and otherwise mutating state, including how and when propagation of the event should stop.

  - `Laminas\EventManager\EventManagerInterface`; start typehinting against the PSR-14 `EventDispatcherInterface`.
  - `Laminas\EventManager\EventManagerAwareInterface`
  - `Laminas\EventManager\EventManagerAwareTrait`
  - `Laminas\EventManager\EventsCapableInterface`; start using `EventDispatchingInterface` instead.
  - `Laminas\EventManager\SharedEventManager`; start using listener providers instead, attaching to identifiers based on event types.
  - `Laminas\EventManager\SharedEventManagerInterface`
  - `Laminas\EventManager\SharedEventsCapableInterface`
  - `Laminas\EventManager\ListenerAggregateInterface`; use the new `ListenerSubscriberInterface` instead.
  - `Laminas\EventManager\ListenerAggregateTrait`; use the new `ListenerSubscriberTrait`, or define your own detachment logic.
  - `Laminas\EventManager\AbstractListenerAggregate`; use the new `AbstractListenerSubscriber`, or define your own detachment logic.
  - `Laminas\EventManager\ResponseCollection`; aggregate state in the event itself, and have the event determine when propagation needs to stop.
  - `Laminas\EventManager\LazyListener`; use `Laminas\EventManager\ListenerProvider\LazyListener` instead.
  - `Laminas\EventManager\LazyEventListener`; use `Laminas\EventManager\ListenerProvider\LazyListener` instead.
  - `Laminas\EventManager\LazyListenerAggregate`; use `Laminas\EventManager\ListenerProvider\LazyListenerSubscriber` instead.
  - `Laminas\EventManager\FilterChain` and the `Filter` subnamespace; these will move to a separate package in the future.

## 3.0.0 - 2016-01-12

### Added

- [Migration documentation](doc/book/migration/) was added.
- [Automated benchmarks](benchmarks/) were added.
- `EventManager::__construct()` now accepts an optional
  `SharedEventManagerInterface` instance as the first argument, and an optional
  array of identifiers as the second. As identifiers have no meaning without a
  shared manager present, they are secondary to providing the shared manager.
- `EventManagerInterface::trigger()` changes its signature to
  `trigger($eventName, $target = null, $argv = [])`; each argument has exactly
  one possible meaning; the `$eventName` can only be a string event name. The
  fourth `$callback` argument is removed.
- `EventManagerInterface::triggerUntil()` changes its signature to
  `triggerUntil(callable $callback, $eventName, $target = null, $argv = null)`.
  Each argument has exactly one meaning.
- `EventManagerInterface` adds two new methods for triggering provided
  `EventInterface` arguments: `triggerEvent(EventInterface $event)` and
  `triggerEventUntil(callable $callback, EventInterface $event)`.
- `EventManagerInterface::attach()` and `detach()` change their signatures to
  `attach($eventName, callable $listener, $priority = 1)` and `detach(callable
  $listener, $eventName = null)`, respectively. Note that `$eventName` can now
  only be a string event name, not an array or `Traversable`.
- `EventManagerInterface::setIdentifiers()` and `addIdentifiers()` change their
  signatures to each only accept an *array* of identifiers.
- `SharedEventManagerInterface::getListeners()` changes signature to
  `getListeners(array $identifiers, $eventName)` and now guarantees return of an
  array. Note that the second argument is now *required*.
- `SharedEventManagerInterface::attach()` changes signature to
  `attach($identifier, $eventName, callable $listener, $priority = 1)`. The
  `$identifier` and `$eventName` **must** be strings.
- `SharedEventManagerInterface::detach()` changes signature to `detach(callable
  $listener, $identifier = null, $eventName = null)`; `$identifier` and
  `$eventName` **must** be strings if passed.
- `ListenerAggregateInterface::attach()` adds an optional `$priority = 1`
  argument. This was used already in v2, but not dictated by the interface.
- `FilterInterface::attach()` and `detach()` have changed signature to
  `attach(callable $callback)` and `detach(callable $ilter)`, respectively.
- `LazyListener` allows wrapping:
  - fetching a listener service from a container-interop container, and
  - invoking a designated listener method with the provided event.
- `LazyEventListener` extends `LazyListener`, and provides metadata for
  discovering the intended event name and priority at which to attach the lazy
  listener; these are consumed by:
- `LazyListenerAggregate`, which, provided a list of `LazyEventListeners` and/or
  definitions to use to create them, acts as an aggregate for attaching a number
  of such listeners at once.
- [zendframework/zend-eventmanager#20](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-eventmanager/pull/20) updates the
  trait `Laminas\EventManager\Test\EventListenerIntrospectionTrait` so that the
  implementation will work with the v3 changes; the tests written for v2
  continue to pass, allowing this trait to be used to provide compatibility
  testing between v2 and v3.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- `GlobalEventManager` and `StaticEventManager` are removed (with prejudice!).
- `ProvidesEvents`, which was previously deprecated, is removed.
- `EventManagerInterface::setSharedManager()` is removed. Shared managers are
  now expected to be injected during instantiation.
- `EventManagerInterface::getEvents()` and `getListeners()` are removed; they
  had now purpose within the implementation.
- `EventManagerInterface::setEventClass()` was renamed to `setEventPrototype()`,
  which now expects an `EventInterface` instance. That instance will be cloned
  whenever a new event is created.
- `EventManagerInterface::attachAggregate()` and `detachAggregate()` are
  removed. Users should use the `attach()` and `detach()` methods of the
  aggregates themselves.
- `SharedEventAggregateAwareInterface` and `SharedListenerAggregateInterface`
  are removed. This was an undocumented and largely unused feature.
- `SharedEventManagerAwareInterface` is removed. A new interface,
  `SharedEventsCapableInterface` defines the `getSharedManager()` method from
  the interface, and `EventManagerInterface` extends that new interface.
- `SharedEventManagerInterface::getEvents()` is removed, as it had no purpose in
  the implementation.
- `ResponseCollection::setStopped()` no longer implements a fluent interface.

### Fixed

- `FilterIterator::insert()` has been modified to raise an exception if the value provided is not a callable.

## 2.6.2 - 2016-01-12

### Added

- [zendframework/zend-eventmanager#19](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-eventmanager/pull/19) adds a new
  trait, `Laminas\EventManager\Test\EventListenerIntrospectionTrait`, intended for
  composition in unit tests. It provides a number of methods that can be used
  to retrieve listeners with or without associated priority, and the assertion
  `assertListenerAtPriority(callable $listener, $priority, $event, EventManager $events, $message = '')`,
  which can be used for testing that a listener was registered at the specified
  priority with the specified event.

  The features in this patch are intended to facilitate testing against both
  version 2 and version 3 of laminas-eventmanager, as it provides a consistent API
  for retrieving lists of events and listeners between the two versions.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- Nothing.

### Fixed

- Nothing.

## 2.6.0 - 2015-09-29

### Added

- Added `Laminas\EventManager\SharedEventsCapableInterface`. This interface will
  largely replace `Laminas\EventManager\SharedEventManagerAwareInterface` in
  version 3, and the latter was updated to extend it.
- Added `EventManager::triggerEvent(EventInterface $event)` as a
  forwards-compatibility feature.
- Add `EventManager::triggerEventUntil(callable $callback, EventIterface $event)`
  as a forwards-compatibility feature.
- Adds [Athletic](https://github.com/polyfractal/athletic) benchmarks to aid in
  gauging performanc impact of changes; these are a development change only.

## 2.5.2 - 2015-07-16

### Added

- [zendframework/zend-eventmanager#5](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-eventmanager/pull/5) adds a number
  of unit tests to improve test coverage, and thus maintainability and
  stability.

### Deprecated

- Nothing.

### Removed

- [zendframework/zend-eventmanager#3](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-eventmanager/pull/3) removes some

  over a copy of `$this`) from the test suite.

### Fixed

- [zendframework/zend-eventmanager#5](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-eventmanager/pull/5) fixes a bug in
  `FilterIterator` that occurs when attempting to extract from an empty heap.
