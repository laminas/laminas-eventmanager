laminas-eventmanager is designed for the following use cases:

- Implementing simple subject/observer patterns.
- Implementing Aspect-Oriented designs.
- Implementing event-driven architectures.

The basic architecture allows you to attach and detach listeners to named events,
both on a per-instance basis as well as via shared collections; trigger events;
and interrupt execution of listeners.
